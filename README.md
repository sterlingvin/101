# to-do-app-with-docker-jerkins-ec2-prometheus-grafana

This tutorial shows how to deploy a simple app to Amplify through a Jerkins CICD pipeline, it covers the following topics:

- Building containers
- Using volumes to persist data
- Using bind mounts to support development
- Using container networking to support multi-container applications
- Creating Jerkins files, integrating Jenkins and GitHub
- Using Jerkins to automate build and deployments
- Deploy multi-docker container to EC2 and monitor using Grafana, Prometheus

## Getting Started

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Developed a Containerized To-Do List Application:**
   - The application code is maintained in a GitHub repository based on this project github.com/StefanScherer/getting-started/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
   - Application uses node base image and MySQL image with appropriate networking
   - Uses a docker-compose file

2. # Set Up GitHub Webhook:
   - Configured a webhook to trigger Jenkins upon new commits to the GitHub repository.

3. # Jenkins Setup on EC2:
   - Jenkins, an open-source automation server, was chosen for CI/CD due to its flexibility and self-hosting capabilities.
   - Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub, builds the Docker image, and pushes it to Docker Hub.
   - Install the following directly on the server Docker, Docker-compose, 
   - Install the following plugins on Jenkins; Github, docker pipeline, Git, build pipeline, etc. Ensure appropriate setup of Jenkins
   - Write scripts carefully, ensure secure and valid authentication credentials, and ensure adequate authorization to EC2 through IAM roles
   - Ensure credentials are handled securely

4. # Deployment to Second EC2 Server:
   - Jenkins sends necessary files (Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, prometheus.yml) to another EC2 server.
   - Jenkins triggers a script on the second EC2 server to pull the Docker image from Docker Hub and start various containers.
   - Install Docker, Docker compose on the second server
   - Ensure containers are stooped and previous images are removed on the server before starting new once
   - Confirm application is running through <Server public IP>:3000

5. # Running Prometheus and Grafana:
   - Prometheus and Grafana run in Docker containers on the second EC2 server.
   - Prometheus extracts metrics like HTTP requests and CPU usage, stores these metrics and integrates with Grafana for visualization.
   - Confirm Prometheus and Grafana are running on HTTP://<IP server address>:9090 and HTTP://<IP server address>:4000 respectively

### Tools and Technologies:

- # Jenkins:
  - Open-source CI/CD tool.
  - Hosted on-premises, providing control over infrastructure.
  - Advantages: Customizable pipelines, extensive plugin ecosystem, and strong community support.

- # Prometheus and Grafana:
  - Open-source monitoring and visualization tools.
  - Prometheus scrapes and stores metrics.
  - Grafana visualizes metrics, creating insightful dashboards.

I will be writing more detailed documentation of the process on my blog, you should check it out with the link

### Why Jenkins?
Jenkins offers several advantages over cloud-based CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, AWS Amplify, and TravisCI:
- **Customizability:** Highly customizable pipelines to suit any development workflow.
- **Control:** Full control over the CI/CD infrastructure, ensuring security and compliance.
- **Community Support:** Vast plugin ecosystem and active community support.

### Benefits of Automated Infrastructure:
- **Efficiency:** Automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention.
- **Consistency:** Ensures consistent application builds and deployments.
- **Scalability:** Easily scalable to accommodate growing project needs.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana ensure system health and performance.

By integrating these open-source tools, I created a robust, automated CI/CD pipeline that enhances development efficiency and system reliability. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in discussing DevOps strategies or need help with similar projects!
